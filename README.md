I'm Ramon, 24, Brazilian. I'm currently taking a BTech in Systems Analysis and Development.

I've got these in my stack right now:

<strong>-HTML<br>
-CSS, Sass<br>
-Javascript/ (some) Typescript<br></strong>

I also have some basic knowledge of <em>PHP, Python, C and C++</em>

I'm learning React/React Native at the moment, and I intend to dive into Kotlin pretty soon ðŸŒŠ
